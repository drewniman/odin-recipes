    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 lb white button mushroom sliced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
      <li>1 lb 85% ground beef</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
      <li>4 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>8 ounces egg noodle</li>
      <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Simmer 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the
        mushrooms and 1/4 tsp salt. Let mushrooms cook, stirring occasionally
        for 5-7 minutes, until liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are
        beginning to brown. Transfer the mushrooms to a separate bowl and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, over medium heat, add another tbsp of olive oil, 1
        finely chopped onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of pepper, and
        1/2 tsp of salt. Cook until the onion is softened (around 5 minutes).
        Add the ground beef to the pot and add 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper. Cook
        the beef for 5-7 minutes until the ground beef is no longer pink.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour to the beef to thicken the stroganoff (about 3 minutes). Add
        1/4 cup of white wine and 4 cups of chicken broth. Make sure to scrape
        the bottom of the pot. Cook for around 5 minutes or until the sauce is
        slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 8 ounces of egg noodles directly to the pot. Cook the noodles
        uncovered, stirring occasionally, for around 10-12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and add 1/2 cup of yogurt and the cooked mushrooms
        from earlier. Stir everything together and plate it up.
      </li>
    </ol>
